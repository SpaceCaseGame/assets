## **Open Source**

"Space Case" will be an open source game. The structure of the game & its accompanying cryptographic network will be available for all to fork and modify. Whether a subset of players prefer playing with an older rule set, there’s a contentious change that needs to be tested in a safe environment, or just a reskin of the world built around the game, the code belongs to everyone.

## **Target Platforms**

Launch in-browser, ideally built in a cross platform engine like Unity for cross porting to mobile.
